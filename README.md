# Agile QA Simulation – JIRA Hands-On Demo

This is a simple simulation of how Agile and JIRA are used from a QA perspective.  
I created an Agile project in JIRA, added an Epic, wrote user stories and tasks, and showed how a sprint is planned and tracked.

What This Project Includes:
- Epic creation (Flight Booking Workflow)
- User stories for key features like Search Flights
- Tasks under each story (QA-focused)
- Sprint planning and issue movement
- Screenshots of each step with explanations

Files:
- `Agile - JIRA Project.docx` → Walkthrough with screenshots
- `snapshots/` → Folder with all screenshots used

Purpose:
To demonstrate practical understanding of JIRA and Agile concepts from a QA role perspective.
